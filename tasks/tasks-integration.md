## integration
DONE + show deviances from h2o-3 as calculated by @arno's code
DONE   (instead of simple residuals)
DONE   [API implementation](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/f610c394cef2942738abf7bba048e43d2335ef62/h2o-core/src/main/java/water/api/ModelMetricsHandler.java)
DONE + make model buttons dynamic
DONE + make model buttons based on model ID
DONE + specify data with props
DONE + render independent variable scatterplot divs with React

+ get variable importance directly from the h2o-3 REST API
+ vertically center partial residuals header
+ set data driven independent plot title width
+ set data driven independent variable type
+ show data driven common values for independent variables
+ UI slider to adjust power scale exponent
+ nice ticks for power scales

+ ensure that default model matches config
